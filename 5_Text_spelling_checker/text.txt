Unil now you have fught for barren rocks
 Laing everything you have accomplished everything
 Yu have won battles without cannon
 crossed rivers without bridges made foced marches without boots
 bivoucked without brandy and often without bread
 Only the phalanx of the Repulic, only the soldiers of Liberty
